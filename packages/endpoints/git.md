# Git Endpoint

Entire Git repos that represent a package can be installed via the Git endpoint.  This can be a public Git server like GitHub or Bitbucket, or a private Git repo behind your firewall.

Make sure the root of your Git repo has a `box.json` inside of it so CommandBox can tell the version and name of the package.  If there is no `box.json`, the name of the repo will be used as the package name.

## Installation

To install a package from a Git repo, use the URL like so:

```bash
install git://github.com/username/repoName.git
install git+https://github.com/username/repoName.git
install git+ssh://git@github.com:username/repoName.git
```

You can target a specific `branch`, `tag`, or `commit` by adding a "commit-ish" to the end of the URL.

```bash
install git://site.com/user/repo.git#development
install git://site.com/user/repo.git#v1.2.3
install git://site.com/user/repo.git#09d302b4fffa0b988d1edd8ea747dc0c0f2883ea
```

## GitHub shortcut

If the repo you wish to install is located on Github.com, you can use this shortcut to specifying the package.

```bash
install username/repoName
```

## In box.json

You can specify packages from folder endpoints as dependencies in your `box.json` in this format.  Remember, JSON requires that backslashes be escaped.

```javascript
{
    "dependencies" : {
        "myPackage" : "git://github.com/username/repoName.git"
    }
}
```

## Authentication

Git repos that allow anonymous pulls do not require any additional configuration for authentication.  CommandBox's Git endpoint supports SSH authentication via public/private keys by using the `git+ssh://` protocol.

```bash
install git+ssh://site.com:user/repo.git#v1.2.3
```

Some Git endpoints \(like private Github repos\) need a user before the site name in the url string like below:

```bash
install git+ssh://git@github.com:user/repo.git
```

> **Info** Note the git+ssh URL is a little different than a HTTP\(S\) URL. There is a colon \(`:`\) after the host instead of a forward slash \(`/`\).

The `git+ssh` endpoint will look for a private SSH key in your `~/.ssh` directory named `id_rsa`, `id_dsa`, or `identity`.  If you are using a multi-key setup with a `~/ssh/config` file, it will be read, and the appropriate key will be used for the host.  The matching public key needs to be registered in the Git server.

> **Info** If you are deploying to a server and you have not previously logged into the Git server from the new machine you will need to make sure the Git server is added to your `known_hosts` file.  The quickest way to do this is to use `git clone git@github.com/user/repo.git` from the terminal OR add the line from your local machine to the server.

Password authentication is not supported yet for HTTP, HTTPS, or SSH Git protocols.
